///           versions may be posted for the purpose of expedient liquidations
///       - Versions are allowed to "fail" and will be marked as .valid = false
///       - Versions must be committed in order, i.e. all issued versions prior to latestVersion must be available
///       - The latest version will always be a "valid" version, invalid versions will not update latest

///         - This is useful for immediately liquidating an account with a valid off-chain price in between orders
///         - Satisfying the above constraints, only versions more recent than the latest version may be committed
